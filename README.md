# Chaos Awakens
Chaos Awakens is a remaster of both the very iconic mod [OreSpawn](https://www.orespawn.com/download/) and [SoulsOfTheFallen's Chaos Awakens mod pack](https://web.archive.org/web/20180314164908/http://www.dangerzonegame.net/mods.html), built from the ground up. This is the branch for the 1.16.5 version for Minecraft Forge.

## Download

Due to drama and various mass reports by unknown sources, the mod was taken down from [*CurseForge*](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods) and cannot be re-uploaded from this point forward. Please do **not** harass **anyone** in the *CurseForge* moderation team or **any** competitor mod developer for what you think they did. They are humans and we are too, and we all make mistakes.

## FAQ
### Q: Will this mod be ported to version x.x.x or *Fabric*?
**A:** We are only going to focus for *Forge* 1.16.5 for the time being, **thus there are currently no plans for backports aside for 1.12.2, forward ports to version 1.17.1, or Fabric/Quilt releases**. However, if you want to port it yourself, feel free to fork the project and pull request your work afterwards.

There will be **absolutely no** port for *Forge* 1.17.1, as *GeckoLib* won't actively support it either as stated in the screenshot below:

### Q: Is this created with *MCreator*?
**A:** No. This mod is not created with *MCreator*. No procedures or similar are seen in this mod. We write our own code. You can even check the mod's code above and confirm this yourself if you know how *MCreator* writes code.

### Q: Who started/made this?
**A:** This was started as an idea from not only the former *OreSpawn* update modders, as well as the admins of the [DangerZone modding Discord](https://discord.gg/hs6FJEDtMd), about a while after the update was cancelled due to social media drama. After a while, it started becoming popular! We hired many amazing developers who have made all this possible.

### Q: Could you please add \<insert base *OreSpawn* element(s) here\>?! This isn't *OreSpawn* without it/them!
**A:** We aren't porting everything from *OreSpawn* in its pure form, and so not only thought is needed to remake that content, it also means that some content will not make the cut.

Unlike the original creator's belief, this has nothing to do with the Minecraft EULA *(which states they own the content, but you own what you make)*, and we aren't removing the end-game content or lock them behind a *'forever beta'* paywall. This has to do more about the more notorious features, such as the *Girlfriend* and *Boyfriend* NPCs.

Going through development of the mod, we may change things here and there, sometimes in a smaller scale, other times in a large scale. __We won't be porting *OreSpawn* 1:1 for copyright reasons.__

_If you still want the original mod with no changes, please instead play the original *OreSpawn* mod, via either [*DangerZone/DangerZone VR*](https://www.orespawn.com/download/), or if you want to just play [older versions for Minecraft V1.5-1.7](https://dangerzone-archive.weebly.com/orespawn.html).

### Q: Why do the assets look so different from *OreSpawn*'s? Why can't you guys just re-use the assets or change them to more alike?
**A:** Here are a few reasons why:
- Most *OreSpawn* textures look pretty outdated, are just lazy, or simply don't fit with Minecraft's art style;
- The creator of *OreSpawn*, [**Richard H. Clark (TheyCallMeDanger)**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Tsf31uosncmWCICYO52Dw), had commented on our former CurseForge page to not use the assets that were created for his mod, as seen in the image below. We will **not** be using anything from the mod that he owns (textures, models, etc.) unless a specific modeller of the mod gives us permission to use theirs.

- Even if we were granted rights to use the assets, they wouldn't fit with the existing assets, and having both would bring more issues than fix things.
